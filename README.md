e-commerce app in Node.js with a REST API and MongoDB. Using advanced authentication with a JSON web token and the mern stack

# E-Commerce App Backend API Development

This repository contains the backend API implementation for an E-Commerce application built with Node.js, MongoDB, and the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, Node.js, and React.js). The API provides a robust foundation for managing various functionalities required in an E-Commerce system, including user authentication, product management, order processing, and more.

## Features

- **User Authentication**: Secure user registration and login using JSON Web Tokens (JWT) for enhanced security.
- **Product Management**: CRUD operations for managing products, including creation, retrieval, update, and deletion.
- **Order Processing**: Efficient handling of orders, including order placement, order history, and status updates.
- **Shopping Cart**: Manage and modify the contents of a user's shopping cart with ease.
- **Payment Integration**: Seamless integration with popular payment gateways to facilitate secure online transactions.
- **Search and Filtering**: Enable users to search for products and apply filters based on various criteria.
- **Reviews and Ratings**: Allow users to leave reviews and ratings for products they have purchased.
- **Authorization and Role-based Access Control**: Implement role-based access control to restrict API endpoints based on user roles.
